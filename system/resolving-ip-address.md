You can resolve the ip address of a domain in your command line with this:
```
‚ùØ getent hosts sahinakkaya.me
51.103.140.199  sahinakkaya.me
```

When you change a setting from your DNS registrar's panel, it does not propagate 
to the world at the same time. So instead of using third party websites to know
what your domain name is pointing at, you can check it locally.
