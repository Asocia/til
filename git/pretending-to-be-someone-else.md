Since I can now sign my commits, I wonder if I can sign commits where the author is Linus Torvalds. Probably, I will be able to do it. 

Edit: Apparently, I don't know how this sign stuff really works. I made everything same but this commit is shown as Unverified.

Last edit: I finally understand how it works. When click the text "Unverified", it says "This user has not yet uploaded their public key". I uploaded it and it still says unverified because I can't verify email. It says "Signed commits authored by this email address will be unverified until the email address is verified" in the GPG keys section of the profile settings. Mystery solved :D
