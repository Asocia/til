I'm reading Pro Git book and I learn some cool stuff. I don't know if I'm going to use these, so I'm not sure if it's a good idea to make seperate files for all the commands. But they are just so cool that I want to note it somewhere. So this file is created specifically for this purpose. If I ever need a command from this file, I will move it to their own file.
