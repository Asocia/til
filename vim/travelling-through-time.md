In vim, you can travel through time! Today I have done many changes to multiple files and I didn't want to press `u` tens of times to undo it. I thought there should be a better way. And there is. It was 6 PM and I wanted to go to 10 AM. That's 8 hours. And the command I need to run was: `:earlier 8h`. OH. MY. GOD. How simple was that? And guess what would I needed to run if I want to go back to 5 minutes before or maybe 4 days? `:earlier 5m` or `:earlier 4d`. And then use `:later ...` to go forward. Example: `:later 45s` to go 45 seconds forward.  I am speechless.
